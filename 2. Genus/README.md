### Design Comparison

| **Metric**       | **Accurate Design**                                                                                                                                                 | **Approximate Design**                                                                                                                                               |

| **Area Report**  | The synthesized **accurate_conv** module requires a total cell area of **2431.163 units** and is composed of **213 logic cells**. This establishes a baseline for the physical size of the accurate design. | The synthesized **approx_conv** module is composed of **221 logic cells** and occupies a total cell area of **2391.047 units**. This provides a quantitative measure of the approximate design's physical size compared to the accurate design. |
| **Power Report** | The total power consumption is approximately **1.345e-04 W**. Registers are the dominant source of power consumption, while internal logic accounts for the majority of the internal and switching power consumption, with **internal power being the largest component overall at 74.62%**. | The total power consumption is approximately **2.014e-04 W**. The approximate design has lower leakage and switching power, but **internal is the dominant power component**, accounting for nearly **80%** of its total consumption. |
| **Timing Report**| The design successfully meets its timing constraints, indicated by a **positive slack of 3835 ps**. The critical path originates from a **kernel[65] input** and ends at an internal register (**acc_reg**), taking **5931 ps** to propagate through a series of adders (ADDFX1, ADDFXL) and logic gates. | The design meets its timing requirements with a **positive slack of 4311 ps**. The approximate design has better timing performance than the accurate design, as indicated by its larger positive slack. This successfully demonstrates the intended performance-for-accuracy trade-off. |
| **Gates Report** | The design is primarily composed of **logic cells (162)** and **sequential cells (33)**. Among individual gates, **adders (ADDFX1, ADDFXL)** and **flip-flops (SDFFRHQX1)** contribute most significantly to the total number of gates, which is expected for a design performing multiply-accumulate operations. | The design's area is primarily made up of **logic cells (164)** and **sequential cells (41)**. The design achieves a smaller total area but paradoxically uses more individual logic cells, with a notable shift towards a higher percentage of sequential logic (**flip-flops**). |
| **Netlist View** | The netlist visualization shows a **moderately complex and structured design**.                                                                                      | The netlist visualization shows a circuit with **significant structural complexity**, in contrast to the accurate design.                                            |
