I performed a Logic Equivalence Check (LEC) to verify that the gate-level netlist of the convolutional block synthesized with Cadence Genus is functionally identical to the RTL Verilog code, checking that no logical errors were introduced during synthesis.

```
Simulation:
1. compare_golden_and_revised
- Snthesized netlist (Revised) is functionally equivalent to the RTL description (Golden), confirming both designs have same number of mapped inputs, outputs, and flip-flops, and no discrepancies are observed.

2. HDL_rule_manager
- No functional mismatches between RTL and the synthesized netlist, but a few warnings exist (multiple non-blocking assignments, bit truncation risk, and blackboxed cells), which can be ignored.

3. Mapping_Manager 
- The Mapping Manager shows detailed mapped points between the Golden and Revised designs.

4. Report_compare 
- Results after running the compare command.

5. Report_statistics 
- Provides a final statistical breakdown of the mapped and equivalent points.

6. Report_verification 
- Final high-level verification report.
