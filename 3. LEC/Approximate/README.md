# Approximate-CNN-hardware
In this project, both accurate and approximate convolutional blocks were designed using Verilog HDL. 
The accurate block computes results with full precision, whereas the approximate block reduces computational complexity by simplifying arithmetic, thereby lowering power and area requirements.
